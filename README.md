# automerge-playground

I used this to play around with [automerge](https://automerge.org/).

Note that this is persisting state in the browser and is communicating between tabs using postMessage. So it does not sync outside of your browser. I did not set up a server to persist state. You can test using multiple tabs though.

The source code is basically an extended version of this tutorial https://automerge.org/docs/tutorial/introduction/
